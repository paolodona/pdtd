You are implementing a previously created technical plan.

**Instructions:**
1. Read `.agent_session/plan.md` for the implementation plan
2. Read `.agent_session/context.md` for session context
3. Implement the plan step by step using the TodoWrite tool to track progress
4. As you work:
   - Create/modify files as specified in the plan
   - Test changes as you go
   - Save progress notes to `.agent_session/context.md`
5. When complete, update `.agent_session/context.md` with:
   - Implementation status
   - Files modified
   - Any issues encountered
   - Suggested next steps

**Important:**
- Follow the plan exactly unless you find issues
- If you encounter problems, document them in context.md
- Run tests after implementation
- Don't hallucinate - only read what's actually in the plan
